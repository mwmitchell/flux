# flux

A Clojure based Solr client. Current Apache Solr version support is `4.9.0`.

## Installation (Leiningen)

To include the Flux library, add the following to your `:dependencies`:

    [com.codesignals/flux "0.6.0"]

## Usage

###Http

```clojure
(require '[flux.http :as http])

(def conn (http/create "http://localhost:8983/solr" :collection1))
```

###Cloud
Create a connection to SolrCloud using one zk host:

```clojure
(require '[flux.cloud :as cloud]
         '[flux.collections :as cloud-api)

(def conn (cloud/create "zk1:2181"))
```

Create a connection to SolrCloud using multiple zk hosts (for failover):

```clojure
(def conn (cloud/create "zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181"))
```

Create a connection to SolrCloud using multiple zk hosts (for failover) and a chroot:

```clojure
(def conn (cloud/create "zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181/mysolrchroot"))
```

Create a connection to SolrCloud using zk and specify a default collection

```clojure
(def conn (cloud/create "zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181/mysolrchroot" "name-of-collection"))
```

Create a new SolrCloud collection with 4 shards:

```clojure
(cloud-api/create-collection conn "my-solr-collection" 4)
```

Create a new SolrCloud collection with 4 shards and replication factor of 2:

```clojure
(cloud-api/create-collection conn "my-solr-collection" 4 2)
```

Create a new SolrCloud collection with 4 shards and replication factor of 2 and additional parameters:

```clojure
(cloud-api/create-collection conn "my-solr-collection" 4 2 { "collection.configName" "schemaless"
                                                  "router.name" "implicit"
                                                  "shards" "x,y,z,p"
                                                  "maxShardsPerNode" 10})
```

The SolrCloud connection is thread-safe and it is recommended that you create just one
and re-use it across all requests. 

Remember to shutdown the connection on exit:

```clojure
(flux/with-connection conn (flux/shutdown))
```

Delete a SolrCloud collection:

```clojure
(cloud-api/delete-collection conn "my-solr-collection")
```

Get a list of active replicas of a collection:

```clojure
(filter active? (all-replicas conn "collection1"))
```

Get a list of not-active replicas (either down or recovering) of a collection:

```clojure
(filter not-active? (all-replicas conn "collection1"))
```

Get a list of down replicas of a collection:

```clojure
(filter down? (all-replicas conn "collection1"))
```

Get a list of recovering replicas of a collection:

```clojure
(filter recovering? (all-replicas conn "collection1"))
```

Get a list of replicas of a collection hosted by host/port:

```clojure
(filter (fn [x] (hosted-by? x "127.0.1.1:8983")) (all-replicas conn "collection1"))
```

Get a list of leaders of a particular collection:

```clojure
(filter leader? (all-replicas conn "collection1"))
```

Wait for all replicas of a given collection hosted by a particular host/port to be in 'active' state:

```clojure
(wait-until-active conn "my-solr-collection" "host1:8983")
```

###Embedded

```clojure
(require '[flux.embedded :as embedded])

(def cc (embedded/create-core-container "path/to/solr-home" "path/to/solr.xml"))
```

####Core auto-discovery
Flux also supports `core.properties`. Just give `create-core` the solr-home path as the only argument.

  Note: It's important to call the `load` method on the resulting `CoreContainer` instance:

```clojure
(def cc (doto (embedded/create-core-container "path/to/solr-home")
              (.load))
```

Now create the embedded server instance:

```clojure
(def conn (embedded/create cc :collection1))
```

###Client
Once a connection as been created, use the `with-connection` macro to wrap client calls:

```clojure
(require '[flux.core :as flux]
         '[flux.query :as q])

(flux/with-connection conn
    (flux/add [{:id 1} {:id 2}])
    (flux/commit)
    (flux/query "*:*")
    ;; Or set the path and/or method:
    (flux/request
      (q/create-query-request :post "/docs" {:q "etc"}))
```

###javax.servlet/servlet-api and EmbeddedSolrServer

Unfortunately, EmbeddedSolrServer requires javax.servlet/servlet-api as an implicit dependency. Because of this, Flux adds this lib as a depedency.

###Test
```shell
lein midje
```
